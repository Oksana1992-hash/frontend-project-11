## Description
RSS is a format for describing news feeds and article announcements, allowing websites (usually blogs) to share updates with users. Using RSS aggregators, users can subscribe to these feeds, receive notifications about new publications and conveniently view the content.

RSS Reader is a service for aggregating RSS feeds. It allows you to add an unlimited number of sources, automatically update them and combine new entries into one stream for convenient reading.
